## Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Opening Hook (1 minute)

**Say:**
> "When implementing RAG for document intelligence, how do you decide between pure RAG and RAG+LLM hybrid approaches?"
> 
> [Wait for responses]
> 
> "Most teams make this decision based on intuition. What if we could quantify the trade-offs empirically?"

**Show:** Main application screen

---

### 2. The Research Problem We Address (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Data science teams implementing RAG face three critical questions:
> 1. **Architecture Decision** - RAG-only vs. hybrid approach?
> 2. **Trade-off Quantification** - What do we gain vs. lose with each approach?
> 3. **Domain Validation** - How do different approaches perform on OUR documents?
> 
> This framework provides empirical answers to all three."

**Show:** Navigate to the empty document library

**Emphasize:**
> "Notice we start with a clean slate - no pre-loaded data, everything happens in real-time."

---

### 3. Document Upload Demo (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Let me show you how simple this is. I have here a [describe your PDF - e.g., 'Climate Action Bill with 127 pages']."

**Do:**
1. Click "Browse files" and select your PDF
2. Click "Queue for Processing"

**Say:**
> "Watch what happens - the document immediately enters our processing queue. No waiting, you can continue working."

**Show:** Point to the progress indicator in the sidebar

**Say:**
> "The system is now:
> - Extracting text from every page
> - Creating intelligent chunks that preserve context
> - Generating AI embeddings for semantic search
> - Storing everything in our persistent database"

**Note:** While processing continues, explain the business value

---

### 4. Business Value Explanation (1 minute during processing)

**Say:**
> "While that processes, let me highlight the immediate benefits:
> - **No downtime** - Users can queue multiple documents
> - **One-time processing** - Never need to re-upload
> - **Team collaboration** - Everyone accesses the same processed documents
> - **Cost effective** - Roughly $0.10 per document to process"

---

### 5. Single-Method Baseline Demonstration (3 minutes)

**Once document is processed:**

**Say:**
> "Let's establish a baseline with pure RAG. This represents the zero-hallucination approach."

**Type Question 1:**
> "What are the main provisions and timeline for implementation?"

**Do:** Click "Ask Question (RAG Only)"

**Point out:**
- **Zero hallucination**: Every claim is cited
- **Deterministic output**: Consistent results
- **Limited scope**: Only document content
- **Metrics tracking**: Tokens, chunks, response time

**Say:**
> "This is your high-accuracy, compliance-safe baseline. But what if we need more comprehensive answers?"

**Show:** Expand citations and highlight a specific chunk

---

### 6. Three-Way Methodology Comparison - The Core Value (5 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Now for the key research capability - simultaneous evaluation of three RAG approaches."

**Type Question 2:**
> "What are the tax implications and who will be affected?"

**Do:** Click "A/B Compare"

**Say:**
> "We're generating three methodologically distinct answers:
> 1. **RAG-Only** - Zero hallucination, document-restricted
> 2. **Non-RAG Control** - Pure LLM baseline
> 3. **RAG+LLM Hybrid** - Enhanced reasoning with managed risk"

**Wait for results, then analyze:**

**Left Column - RAG Answer:**
> "Pure document retrieval: 100% citation coverage, zero hallucination risk, but limited to explicit content."

**Right Column - Toggle to Non-RAG:**
> "Control group: Shows what we lose without document grounding. Notice no citations, potential inaccuracies."

**Toggle to Hybrid:**
> "Enhanced approach: Document facts + contextual understanding. Better completeness, but introduces hallucination risk."

**Key Research Point:**
> "This quantifies the accuracy vs. completeness trade-off. Your data science team can now measure rather than guess which approach works best."

---

### 7. Document Library Demo (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Let's look at document management capabilities."

**Show:** 
- Multiple documents in library with status indicators
- Click between different documents
- Show instant switching with no reload time

**Say:**
> "Your team builds a knowledge base over time. Process once, query forever. No subscription fees for storage."

**Do:** Generate a document summary to show another feature

---

### 8. Performance Metrics (1 minute)

**Point to metrics above answers:**

**Say:**
> "Complete transparency on performance:
> - Response time: 2-3 seconds average
> - Token usage: Optimized to minimize API costs
> - Chunks used: Shows retrieval effectiveness
> 
> You can track ROI and optimize usage patterns."

---

### 9. Compelling Queries (3 minutes)

**Demonstrate power with specific questions:**

**Question 3:**
> "What specific dates and deadlines are mentioned?"

**Question 4:**
> "What are the penalties for non-compliance?"

**Question 5:**
> "How does this compare to existing regulations?" [Good for Hybrid mode]

**For each, emphasize:**
- Speed of response
- Accuracy with citations
- Cost savings vs. manual review

---

### 10. Research Summary & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "This framework enables evidence-based RAG architecture decisions:
> - **Empirical measurement** of accuracy vs. completeness trade-offs
> - **Quantified hallucination rates** for risk assessment
> - **Domain-specific evaluation** with your actual documents
> - **Statistical rigor** through controlled comparison
> 
> No more guessing about which RAG approach to use."

**Research Questions:**
> "What specific document types would you want to evaluate?"
> 
> "What's your tolerance for hallucination vs. need for completeness?"

**Offer:**
> "Let's design an evaluation protocol with your documents and use cases. You'll have quantitative evidence for your architecture decisions within a week."

## Common Questions & Quick Answers

### "How do we know which approach to choose?"
**Show:** The metrics comparison across all three modes
> "The framework provides quantitative data: hallucination rates, completeness scores, citation coverage. You decide based on evidence, not intuition."

### "What about hallucination in hybrid mode?"
**Do:** Point to the hybrid response and identify any potential hallucinations
> "We measure actual hallucination rates with your documents. Typically 5-10% for hybrid vs. 0% for RAG-only. The question is whether the completeness gain justifies the risk."

### "Can this work with our domain-specific documents?"
**Say:**
> "That's the key value - we test with YOUR documents, not generic benchmarks. Different domains show different trade-offs."

### "How do we validate the results scientifically?"
**Show:** Export capabilities and metrics
> "All metrics export to CSV for statistical analysis. You can run significance tests, confidence intervals, whatever your research standards require."

### "What if we need regulatory compliance?"
**Say:**
> "RAG-only mode gives you zero hallucination for compliance-critical applications. The framework helps you identify exactly when you need this vs. when hybrid is acceptable."

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If upload fails:
> "Let me use one of our test documents to continue the demo..."
[Use existing processed document]

### If API errors occur:
> "This demonstrates our error handling - the system gracefully reports issues without crashing."
[Switch to showing already processed results]

### If processing is slow:
> "Large documents take time to process properly - but remember, this is one-time. Once processed, queries are instant."

### If questions return poor results:
> "Let me rephrase that question to better match how the document presents information..."
[Use a prepared question that you know works]
