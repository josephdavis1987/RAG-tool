- [x] Add RAG+LLM Hybrid answer generation with enhanced prompts
- [x] Implement comprehensive response time and token usage tracking
- [x] Create three-way comparison interface in Streamlit
- [x] Add instant toggle switch for right column (Non-RAG vs Hybrid)
- [x] Generate all three answers simultaneously for efficiency
- [x] Perfect visual alignment between left and right columns
- [x] Add performance metrics display above each answer type
- [x] Optimize metrics layout to prevent text wrapping
- [x] Test all three comparison modes with government documents

### Testing & Validation
- [x] Test PDF loading with sample government bill
- [x] Test chunking strategy with realistic documents
- [x] Test embedding generation and storage
- [x] Test hybrid retrieval (semantic + local neighbors)
- [x] Test end-to-end question answering with citations
- [x] Validate background processing system

### Deployment & GitHub Integration
- [x] Create .gitignore to protect API keys and sensitive files
- [x] Set up Git repository and GitHub integration
- [x] Add Streamlit Cloud configuration (.streamlit/config.toml)
- [x] Configure secrets management for deployment
- [x] Successfully deploy to GitHub for Streamlit Cloud hosting
- [x] Update all documentation for deployment readiness

- [x] Answers include accurate source citations  
- [x] Hybrid retrieval works (semantic + local context)
- [x] Background processing eliminates wait time
- [x] Updated Streamlit interface functional (app_v2.py)
- [x] SQLite persistence for processed documents
- [x] Document library and management interface
- [x] Real-time progress tracking
- [x] Token limiting prevents context errors
- [x] A/B/C testing interface for comprehensive RAG value-add analysis
- [x] Three-way performance metrics tracking and display
- [x] Instant mode switching without regeneration
- [x] Perfect visual alignment and stakeholder-ready presentation

## ðŸ§ª Test Documents
- [x] test_bill.pdf - 7-section climate bill (fully working)
- [ ] Inflation Reduction Act PDF (optional - for scale testing)
- [ ] Other government legislation (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Final Status
**âœ… 100% COMPLETE & DEPLOYED** - Production-ready RAG system with background processing, SQLite persistence, full Streamlit interface, and advanced A/B/C testing capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Three-way comparison**: RAG Only vs Non-RAG LLM vs RAG+LLM Hybrid
- **Simultaneous generation**: All answers generated at once for efficiency  
- **Instant switching**: Toggle between modes without regeneration
- **Perfect alignment**: Stakeholder-ready visual presentation
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Response time, tokens, chunks, context tracking
- **Deployment ready**: Streamlit Cloud configuration and GitHub integration

**Launch Commands:**
- **Local**: `streamlit run app_v2.py`
- **Deployed**: Available on Streamlit Community Cloud
- **Repository**: https://github.com/josephdavis1987/RAG-tool
